cookup 0.1


DESCRIPTION



RATIONALE

Cookup was inspired in homebrew for MacOSX, 
however I wanted a tool with minimal requirements (C/C++ compiler and Perl),
to build and install software on super computers and clusters that 
often do not have Ruby or Python.

REQUIEREMENTS

* C/C++ compiler
* Perl 5
