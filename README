cookup 0.1

DESCRIPTION

Easy build from source and install tool for UNIX platforms (using perl)

RATIONALE

Cookup was inspired in homebrew for MacOSX, although does not aim to be as complete.
I wanted a tool with minimal requirements (C/C++ compiler and Perl),
to build and install software on super computers and clusters that 
often do not have Ruby or Python.

REQUIEREMENTS

* C/C++ compiler
* Perl 5
